## Executive Summary

Shrub Fund represents a paradigm shift in decentralized finance, introducing a fully on-chain, transparent fund management protocol built on Solana. By combining professional trading expertise with blockchain transparency and user sovereignty, Shrub Fund eliminates traditional barriers to sophisticated investment strategies while maintaining complete decentralization*.

Unlike traditional hedge funds that require minimum investments of $100K+ and lock up capital for months, Shrub Fund enables any user to participate in professional trading strategies with as little as $1 USDC, withdraw with just a 7-day notice period, and maintain full transparency of all trades and positions in real-time.

The protocol has successfully deployed on Solana mainnet with a modest $10k initial test fund, demonstrating real functional validation.

## 1. Introduction

### The Problem

Traditional investment management faces critical limitations:

- **High Barriers to Entry**: Minimum investments of $100,000+ effectively excluding retail investors
- **Opacity**: Black-box strategies with quarterly reporting at best  
- **Long Lock-ups**: Capital tied up for 1-2 years with limited liquidity
- **High Fees**: 2% management + 20% performance fees
- **Centralized Risk**: Single points of failure and counterparty risk

DeFi has democratized many financial services, but sophisticated fund management remains centralized and inaccessible to most users.

### The Solution

Shrub Fund introduces a fully decentralized fund management protocol* that:

- **Eliminates Minimums**: Start investing with any amount of USDC
- **Ensures Transparency**: All trades, positions, and NAV calculations on-chain, and easily monitored live using DeFi portfolio trackers
- **Provides Liquidity**: 7-day unstaking period vs. years-long lockups
- **Reduces Costs**: No management fees, minimal 2% performance-based compensation only
- **Removes Intermediaries**: Direct smart contract interactions, no custodians*

## 2. Protocol Overview

### Core Concept

Shrub Fund operates as an open-ended investment vehicle where users stake USDC to receive proportional shares representing their ownership in a professionally managed trading portfolio. The fund's value is calculated in real-time based on current market prices of all holdings, including traditional tokens and advanced derivatives.

- Hierarchical user organization (100,000 users per registry)
- Automatic registry expansion when capacity reached
- Efficient storage and lookup mechanisms
